# Arthimatic-calculator-in-C
Developed a simple arithmetic calculator using the C programming language, allowing users to perform basic arithmetic operations. The program takes two numbers and an arithmetic operator (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or power) as input from the user, then applies the selected operation and provides the result. This project demonstrates proficiency in C programming, handling user input, and performing mathematical calculations.
